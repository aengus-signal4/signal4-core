"""
Speaker Identification System
==============================

Modular, incremental speaker identification using rich signals from:
- Channel and episode descriptions
- Speaker metrics (duration, segments, quality)
- High-quality embeddings
- Full transcripts (future phases)

This system replaces the cluster-first approach with signal-rich identification,
achieving 90%+ speaker coverage through graduated strategies.

# Name Aliases for Speaker Identification
# ========================================
# Maps non-standard names (handles, nicknames, typos) to canonical real names.
# Used by Phase 3 label propagation to standardize anchor names.
#
# Format:
#   canonical_name:
#     - alias1
#     - alias2
#
# The canonical name should be the "First Last" format when known.
# Aliases are case-insensitive during matching.

# Known mappings (manually verified)
aliases:
  # Rebel News hosts
  "David Freiheit":
    - "Viva Frei"
    - "Viva Fry"  # Typo variant
    - "Viva"
    - "Viva Barnes"  # When appearing solo (not with Robert Barnes)
    - "Viva Freiheit"

  "Robert Barnes":
    - "Barnes"

  "Sheila Gunn Reid":
    - "Sheila Gunn-Reed"  # Hyphenated variant

  "Adam Soos":
    - "Adam Sos"  # Typo

  # Handles that need real name mapping (TODO: verify)
  # "John Smith":
  #   - "mistersunshinebaby"

  # "Jane Doe":
  #   - "MisterWhite"

# Names flagged as handles (need manual research to find real names)
# These will be logged during processing for review
unresolved_handles:
  - "mistersunshinebaby"
  - "MisterWhite"
  - "the pleb"
  - "Endeavour"
  - "Billboard Chris"
  - "The Distributist"

# Typically co-hosts who appear together frequently
do_not_merge:
  - ["Ian Sénéchal", "Frank"]       # Co-hosts on "Ian et Frank" podcast
  - ["Ian Sénéchal", "François Fournier"]  # Co-hosts
